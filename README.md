# Chaos Helper
It's a helper program for `Path of Exile`. `Chaos Orb` is a currency item mostly used when trading items in `Path of Exile`.

As one way to get a `Chaos Orb`, you can sell a set of items which satisfies at least one of certain [rules](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Chaos_Orb#Vendor_recipes). So many users store and manage the ingredients in a large stash but it's annoying to manage them.

To help the management, this helper checks a user's stash and then shows how many ingredients are in the stash, grouped by item type of the ingredients. Also it shows each set of ingredients to let the user know which items should be sold.

This helper only runs on Windows.
